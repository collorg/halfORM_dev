    To use the foreign keys as direct attributes of the class, copy/paste the Fkeys bellow in
    your code as a class attribute and replace the empty string(s) key(s) with the alias you
    want to use. The aliases must be unique and different from any of the column names. Empty
    string keys are ignored.

    Fkeys = {{
        {}
    }}
